      <h1>About Crypto Dash</h1>
      <p>
        Crypto Dash is a dynamic and user-friendly cryptocurrency tracking
        platform that lets you explore the market in real time. You can easily
        search for any coin by name or symbol, and choose how many coins to
        display â€” 5, 10, 20, or more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform includes advanced sorting features, allowing you to sort
        coins by market cap, current price, or 24-hour change, in both ascending
        and descending order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each coin is presented with a clean info card, and clicking on it takes
        you to a dedicated details page with key insights about the selected
        cryptocurrency. Designed for both desktop and mobile, Crypto Dash offers
        a smooth, responsive, and modern experience tailored for crypto
        enthusiasts of all levels.
